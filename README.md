# 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
# 2. Encoding Technique
# 3. Feature Engineering:
## log transformation
## box-cox transformation
# 4. Feature Selection:
## Isolation Forest algorithm to identify and separate outliers/ anomalies from the normal data points
## PPS (Predictive Power Score) to find the relationships between features. Compare its findings with the correlation matrix.
